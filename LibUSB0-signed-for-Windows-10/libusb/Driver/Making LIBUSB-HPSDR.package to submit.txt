Here is the process to make the cab file for the LIBUSB-HPSDR
driver and to submit to Microsoft.

A lot of this process is found on:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/drivers/develop/attestation-signing-a-kernel-driver-for-public-release

The information in the 'Register Your Company' section is somewhat misleading.  Visit this site instead:
https://sysdev.microsoft.com/en-US/Hardware and follow the process to create an account, and to submit a signed 'winqual.exe'
file.  If you end up at a page where is says to sign an XML file and such, you are at the wrong place!

After creating the accocunt and giving yourself all kinds of rights and privileges, click in the 'File Signing Services'.  You will be
told that you don't have the privileges needed, and it will suggest signing some documents (agreements).  THere are currently about 10 of them
to sign.  Once you sign them all, you will be allowed to the Driver submittal section.  At this point, you need to learn how to
make a .cab file.  You will find that you need to create a .ddf file, so that you can make a cab file.  Instructions for a .ddf
file are found at: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb417343.aspx#dir_file_syntax

Then run MakeCab from the command line, with likely the directory where all the files are as the current directory (or at least where the .ddf
file is...):
MakeCab /f "D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\LibUSB-HPSDR.ddf

; *** LibUSB-HPSDR.ddf ***
;
.OPTION EXPLICIT     ; Generate errors
.Set CabinetFileCountThreshold=0
.Set FolderFileCountThreshold=0
.Set FolderSizeThreshold=0
.Set MaxCabinetSize=0
.Set MaxDiskFileCount=0
.Set MaxDiskSize=0
.Set CompressionType=MSZIP
.Set Cabinet=on
.Set Compress=on
; Specify file name for new cab file
.Set CabinetNameTemplate=LibUSB-HPSDR.cab
; Specify the subdirectory for the files.  
; Your cab file should not have files at the root level, 
; and each driver package must be in a separate subfolder.
.Set DestinationDir=LibUSB-HPSDR
; Specify files to be included in cab file
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\LibUSB-HPSDR.Inf
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\LibUSB0.dll
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\LibUSB0.sys
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\LibUSB0_x64.dll
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\LibUSB0_x64.sys
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\inf-wizard.exe
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\install-filter.exe
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\testlibusb.exe
D:\HPSDR\LibUSB\Driver\testlibusb-win.exe

--------------------------------
Running MakeCab will create 'setup.inf' and 'setup.rpt' files, which can subsequently be ignored or deleted.
--------------------------------

The next steps are to sign and submit the cab file, following the directions on the Attestation Signing page.
Note that you should probably run 'INF2CAT' on your .inf file to ensure that it is (still) correct.  Inf2Cat is likely found in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86

A reasonable command line would be:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x86\inf2cat" /driver:. /OS:10_x86,10_x64

If this runs well, and without error, you have a good chance that the driver cab file submittal process will complete.
